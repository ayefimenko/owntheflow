# Security Guidelines

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** expose sensitive API keys with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- Use server-side environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development/production

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server side
- Sanitize HTML content to prevent XSS attacks
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate UUIDs and other data formats

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Validate user permissions on every request
- Implement session timeout and refresh logic

### Error Handling
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- Log detailed errors only in development
- Use generic error messages in production
- Implement proper error monitoring

### Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use different limits for different operations
- Monitor for suspicious activity patterns

### Content Security
- Sanitize all user-generated content
- Implement content approval workflows
- Use CSP headers to prevent XSS
- Validate file uploads and types
